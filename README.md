# ML-Project-Logistics-Delivery-Time-Prediction
📦 Machine Learning project for predicting delivery times in logistics. Uses real-world data to analyze factors like distance, traffic, and order details. Trains and evaluates models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to optimize delivery schedules and improve customer satisfaction.


# Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a machine learning pipeline that can estimate delivery times based on a set of influencing factors such as:

- Distance between restaurant and customer

- Order details (type and quantity of food)

- Traffic conditions and weather data

- Delivery partner availability and working hours

By analyzing these variables, our model provides an accurate prediction of delivery time, which helps businesses optimize routes, manage resources more effectively, and reduce delays.


# Methodology

The project follows a structured workflow:

- Dataset Collection – A real-world dataset is sourced from Kaggle (Delivery Time Prediction Dataset).

- Data Preprocessing – Includes cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.

- Model Development – At least two machine learning models are implemented and compared (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).

- Evaluation – Performance is measured using regression metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to identify the most effective model.

- Deployment – The trained model and project files are organized and uploaded to GitHub. As a bonus, a simple Streamlit app may be included for interactive prediction.



# Expected Outcomes

- A reliable machine learning model capable of predicting delivery times.

- Clear documentation and Jupyter notebooks showing the entire pipeline.

- Insights into the most influential factors affecting delivery time.

- A potential decision-support tool for logistics companies to enhance customer satisfaction.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to address practical, real-world challenges in the logistics industry.
